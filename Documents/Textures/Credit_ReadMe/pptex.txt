Description             : Here's a texture pack consisting of some modified
                          Doom's E1 textures. The textures fits E1
                          spirit yet looks and tiles a little differently.
                          I aimed for an easy alignment with 64 grid and
                          well vertical and horizontal tiling. All the
                          edits were made by me, I used only Doom1
                          resources as a base.
                          
                          The zip file contains two versions of the pack:
                          One for Doom 1 (TEXTURE1+TEXTURE2) and one for
                          Doom 2 (TEXTURE1 only). Contents are the same
                          in both.
                          
                          This pack has some switches, too. I had to 'merge'
                          them with Doom's stock switches, to retain vanilla
                          compatibility. Don't worry, all of the stock
                          switches are left as they were, only the new ones
                          are 'attached' to them and visible with a use of
                          X offset.
                          
                          By the way, I realize that metal supports and
                          GARG/SATYR/LION switches aren't E1 textures. But
                          they are definitely connected with Romero, as he
                          used them a lot in D2 and E4 maps. So you can
                          find some nice variations of these walls in this
                          pack too. :)
