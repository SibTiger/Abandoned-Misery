* Description *

This is a set of textures and flats converted from some Quake developement
sources and mods out there that haven't been introduced in Doom yet. I tried
to combine as many different styles and environments as possible and still
making them fit together as good as possible. You will find everything from
brick to tech base, from light sources to hellish flesh, from metal to rock,
just take a look, includes over 600 new textures! It has so many different things,
you can even build a complete new map by just using these resources! Try it :)
