General Description     : Sabbat Martyr is a large Deathmatch and Deathmatch-variant wad for Skulltag 97c2 [or above] that's similar to NDCP or Community 	
		  	  Chest.  It contains 40 maps from various authors, all of which differ in theme, layout, detail-level, gameplay, and atmosphere.
			  There's lots of new content besides the 40+ maps...some of which is a new color palette, new skins and bots, new sound effects
			  for the Doom 2 weapons, and many many more cool effects and content.  I tend to think of it as a "add-on" wad for Skulltag.

			  There are also 2 new weapons apart from Skulltag's; the NailGun and the Karasawa.

			  NailGun:
			    The NailGun is a diabolical weapon, feared by many demons and marines alike.  It propells a spread of 5 razor sharp nails at
			  an incredible velocity towards the intended target.  Upon impact, the nails rip apart the flesh with ease, doing insane
			  amounts of damage.  However, with its shotgun spread, range is limited in that the farther the nails have to travel 
			  through the air, the bigger the spread, so it should be reserved for close range fighting to conserve ammo.

			  Karasawa:
			    The Karasawa High-Density Laser Rile [or just "Karasawa"] is a laser rife based off of the same technology used in the Plasma
			  Rifle.  However, unlike the Plasma Rifle, the Karasawa fires large fusing plasma bolts at a high velocity, doing moderate damage
			  to the receiveing end.  Due to the nature of the fusing plasma, it does not have a rapid fire capability like the Plasma Rifle, 
			  but it does do a respectable amount of damage-per-shot to balance that out.  This weapon is best used in medium-to-long range
			  battles.

* Play Information *

Game                    : Doom 2
Map #                   : SMDM01 thru SMDM42
Single Player           : No
Cooperative 2-4 Player  : No
Deathmatch 2-4 Player   : Definitly (that's what its designed for)
Other game styles       : Other Deathmatch variants (LMS, Duel, etc). 
Difficulty Settings     : Only implemented with bots.


* Construction *

Base                    : New from scratch
Build Time              : 8 Months
Editor(s) used          : Doom Builder, SLADE, DeePSea, XWE, SLumpEd, GIMP 2.2, Gif Movie Gear, MSPaint, Audacity, ModTracker, Wad Cleaner
Known Bugs              : - There are some OpenGL bugs which include fubar'd skyboxes, weird rendering, and the lack of any horizon line rendering.
                            However, this is a Skulltag 97c2 bug, and not the fault of SMDM.  If a furture verison is released with the udpated 
			    ZDoomGL code, they will be fixed.
			  - If you have annoucners in your /announcer folder, they can [and will] mess with the new sounds effects.  Nothing can be done                                  about this on my behalf, unfortunately.
			  - Some bots may not be very compatible with some of the maps...however, all of the maps will still function with the bots to the    
                            point to where its playable.  One map in particular is SMDM42.
			  - The SPREAD Rune does not with with the new weapons.  This is a Skulltag bug and not a SMDM bug, but I thought it was worth
			    mentioning.
May Not Run With...     : Anything lower then Skulltag v97c3, 8 Track, w/o legs, your face.
