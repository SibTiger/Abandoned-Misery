Seeing as how these are all relatively simple modifications of DOOM 2
textures, I don't see why I should get much (if any) credit for this.
If you would like to use these textures, just mention that I compiled
them, but don't go out of your way to credit me for making these
textures, basically.  I do ask that you give id Software and Paul
Fleschute credit, however.  Also, if you use these textures in a
released level or megawad/TC, please let me know so I can see them
in action! :)
