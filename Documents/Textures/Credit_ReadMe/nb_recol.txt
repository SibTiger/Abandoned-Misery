Description             : These textures are all recoloured versions of
			  textures from Doom and Doom 2.  They include
			  different coloured lights, golden versions of
			  the SHAWNx and related textures, water and
			  lava falls, and so on.

			  A few of these textures were included in
			  previous texture packs, but most of them have
			  since been improved.  They generally still
			  have the same name, so you should be able to
			  simply copy 'n' paste on top of the older
			  versions.

			  For the sake of completeness, I've also
			  included all the original Doom 1 textures.
			  Some of these have been 'improved', as have a
			  few Doom 2 textures (such as CRATx, DOORSTOP,
			  and SUPPORT2).

			  Version 2 adds an additional 250 or so new
			  textures (including several specifically
			  intended for use in CTF maps), a couple of
			  dozen new flats, and modifications to several
			  textures from v1.

			  Much effort has been put into making certain
			  v1 textures bear a greater resemblance to the
			  stock Doom (2) textures; for example, the red
			  marble textures are now a closer match for
			  SP_HOT.

			  A word of warning: don't try adding new
			  textures to this wad via WinTex.  WinTex is
			  incapable of handling more than a certain
			  number of texture entries, and will corrupt
			  the TEXTURE1 and PNAMES lump if you add even
			  one more to this particular wad.  You'll need
			  to use another utility - such as SLumpEd, XWE,
			  or DeePSea - instead.

Additional Credits To	: ID Software for the original textures (from
			  Doom 1, Doom 2, and the Doom Alpha).

			  Michael Mesko for the lava fall.

			  TTALL1_2 and a couple of others.
