These textures were converted by Derek Mac Donald aka Afterglow.
I can be contacted at derekmd@frad.org and you can get more
textures for Doom2 at my site http://www.doomworld.com/afterglow/
Also thanks to Nick Baker for some work with the conversion.
I've included a zdoom animdefs lump to give the 'quake swirl'
effect to two liquid flats. Enjoy.

Information

basically this is a set of textures i made for a map i also made called
Peace and Love Incorporated (available at my site).  It's more of an
industrial park type set of textures and they are all relatively the
same, with minor tweeks i needed to do for the pli map.  i made a new
set of weapon pad icons and spawn pads as well, although i didnt make
a special pad for the 666, quad, or eyes.  i removed my site logo and
specialty mips as i didn't think anyone would really want those.  if
you do, i will send...

i used photoshop and debabilizer to make these textures.

anyone is welcome to hack at these and use them as a base for their
own if they want.  i actually left in blank (non detailed, like rivets)
so you could add special details of your own and not worry about tiling
problems and the like.  many textures are similar and just shifts or
augmentations of others to vary up things.  check out my map for ways
i used the textures.  all i ask is if you mess and release textures
based on mine, you give the proper credit.  also they convert relatively
well to the q2 palette, so go ahead if you want to.  i may do this later
if bored enough.

hope you can use 'em, and i hope you enjoy.
