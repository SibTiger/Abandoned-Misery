Description             : This is just a PLAYPAL/COLORMAP
                          replacement that changes DOOM into a
                          *mostly* black and white game. The red
                          range is left as-is.
                          
                          I originally put this together back in
                          the late nineties and it languished on
                          my hard drive afterwards. Sometime
                          recently, I think it was the film "Sin
                          City" that reminded me of this.

                          I looked around and there is another
                          B&W PWAD called "ww-nfoir.wad".
                          However it doesn't leave the red range
                          alone: That's made B&W too.

                          I also threw in some new BSPLAT
                          sprites taken from "gib.wad"; another
                          PWAD sitting on my HD.
